# Senior Capstone Project

For my senior capstone project at Chatham University, I worked with a team to develop an information kiosk to be placed on campus. The project involved the design and creation of the user interface with the goal of maintaining a human-centered design. The user interface was programed using Python in a Tkinter window. The design resembles a cartoon face that is animated and interacts with the user. The eyes on the face are able to blink, as well as follow the user as they move about. When there are no users present the face closes its eyes and resembles a sleeping face. 

Our team conducted a survey to gather options on how the interface should be designed. We performed a statistical data analysis on the gathered data, and incorporated this into our final design. The anticipated outcome of this project was to have completed an interactive user interface for the information kiosk.
